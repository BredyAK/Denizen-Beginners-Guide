**TODO: Introduce the idea of flags**

**TODO: Explain why flags are different from defs (defs are queue attached, flags are global or object attached, and also that flags persist a very long time)**

**TODO: Showcase setting and reading server flags in-game using `/ex`**

**TODO: Explain the usage of the 'has_flag' tag**

**TODO: Introduce the idea of flags attached to objects**

**TODO: Showcase setting and reading player flags in-game using `/ex`**

**TODO: Brief mention of the idea that flags are only loaded when the object is loaded, and link out to 'flag system' lang for if users want more detail**

**TODO: List the other things that can be flagged (NPCs, Mobs, General entities, Locations/Blocks, Items) - note that item flags will be covered more later ('custom items' page)**

**TODO: Explain the flag expiration system, including how to set expirations, how to check if a flag is expired, and how to check when a flag will expire - do not detail how they work internally, but maybe give an outref link for that and/or a note about not assuming expirations work in a trackable manner**

**TODO: Quick review of data actions, explaining that they work the same with flags as they do on defs**

**TODO: Brief mention of flag submapping, but leave the details out for a possible future Advanced section page**

**TODO: Mention flag event switches, 'flagged' and 'server_flagged'**

**TODO: Brief mention of the internal flags generated by zap and cooldown, and/or the general idea of double-underscore prefix meaning a flag is internal**

**TODO: Mention that other long-term memory options exist - yaml, sql, etc**
